 In the \underline{\textbf{first chapter}} with a review character, the main currently known methods for detecting single photons for use in quantum communication systems are considered. The analysis and comparison of various types of photon detectors are carried out, the choice of the single photon detector (SPD) studied in the work based on avalanche breakdown is justified. Possible attacks by a potential attacker on measuring equipment are shown, as well as known countermeasures against this type of attack.

 \underline{\textbf{Second chapter}} is devoted to the study of a detector based on avalanche breakdown in a photodiode, which is used as measuring device for registering the result of interference of quantum states in a subcarrier-wave QKD system. This type of SPD is usually used for mid range distances of up to 100 ~ km with losses in communication lines less than 15~dB.

It's main advantages are following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item High frequency trigger pulses - up to 100~MHz.
	\item The ability to supply strobe pulses from an external device (External gating mode).
	\item Wide range of setting the width of the operation window (gate) - from 0.5~ns to 25~ns.
	\item Setting the delay of opening the response window relative to the gate pulse (Trigger delay) in the range up to 10~ns with high resolution in time - 10~ps.
	\item Ability to set <<dead time>> in a wide range - from 0.1~μs to 100~μs.
	\item The ability to adjust quantum efficiency in increments of 2.5~\% in the range from 5~\% to 25~\%.
	\item The semiconductor structure of an APD - InGaAs/InP.
	\item Relatively low level of dark counting with given parameters of quantum efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

In the course of the study, to ensure realistic conditions for the eavesdropper to attack the measuring device as part of the SCW QKD system, it was considered as a <<black box>> and it was not opened and no manipulations were made with internal boards and microcircuits. All detector settings were set in accordance with the standard mode for SCW QKD system.

In order to successfully carry out a FSA, an eavesdropper needs to manipulate the detector
 in a way of forcing the clicks and their absence at the right time. It is assumed that the type of measuring device used is known to the eavesdropper, but there is no direct access to it. In that case the model is limited by the possibility of influencing the detector only by optical methods directly from the quantum channel.

It is known that APD in the linear mode, when a constant optical power is supplied to it, the photocurrent increases. Therefore, when a constant value is applied, the reverse bias voltage $-V_{bias}$ and in the presence of a resistor extinguishing the avalanche in the circuit, the voltage drop across the resistor increases, and on APD is reduced. The essence of the attack lies in switching the detector from the Geiger mode, or <<blinding>> it. Thus, it's operating mode is shifted relative to the breakdown voltage of the APD. With this approach, even additional pulses of $V_{gate}$ become insufficient and the diode is always in the mode of linear dependence of the photocurrent on the incident optical power.  

Nevertheless, in linear mode, it remains possible to exceed the threshold value of the photocurrent $I_{det}$ and generate a detector impulse.

Thus, the technique of removing the detector from the photon-counting mode to the linear mode for carrying out the FSA is easily formalized. An experimental study of the vulnerability of the SPD to this type of attack is carried out in three stages, shown in the figure \ref{fig:Method_2.3}:
%
 \begin{figure}[ht] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Method_2.3.eps}
  \caption{Blinding methods}
  \label{fig:Method_2.3}
\end{figure}
%
 \begin{enumerate}
	\item Determining the constant optical power sufficient to switch the detector from the Geiger mode.
	\item Optical pulse adjustment for the SPD gate
	\item Dependence of the click probability on the photon energy in the trigger pulse value.
\end{enumerate}
%
As a result of the experimental study detector click probabilities were obtained (fig. \ref{fig:Probability_vs_Energy}). 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Probability_vs_Energy.png}
  \caption{Detector click probability as a function of trigger pulse energy}
  \label{fig:Probability_vs_Energy}
\end{figure}


Thus, it has been shown that the use of SPD based on APD in the Geiger mode (id210) with a gating frequency of 100~MHz requires the use of additional means of protection against attack with the switching from the Geiger mode using short optical pulses with an energy of at least 15.4~fJ and at a constant level of optical illumination with an average radiation power level of at least 35~nW. 

The model of the FSA on SCW~QKD systems is proposed in the \underline{\textbf{third chapter}}. The applicability limits of this attack are estimated taking into account the characteristics and equipment parameters in the receiver unit. To determine the eavesdropper attempts to carry out the attack described above, it is proposed to measure the intensity of the central optical mode. The central mode is reflected by a narrow-band filter based on the Bragg grating. In order to be able to measure it, a fiber optic circulator is installed in the circuit. All radiation, which, after phase modulators in the receiving unit, enters the first port of the circulator is sent to the second port to the optical filter. The reflected central mode is sent to the third port of the circulator. In order to measure the central one, which, as shown in the section, should be of the order of 700 ~ nW, it is proposed to use a monitor photodiode. As. If the eavesdropper has the opportunity to select the intensity on the central mode, it is obvious that the monitor photodiode installed at the output from the 3rd port can also be controlled by optical methods. In order to avoid this, it is proposed to use a fiber optic mirror, for example a widely available Faraday mirror, and a fixed passive optical attenuator. The monitor photodiode itself is proposed to be installed in the 4th port of the circulator. Thus, the radiation with the central mode arrives at the 3rd port, passes the attenuator in the forward direction, is reflected from the fiber mirror, passes the attenuator in the opposite direction, and arrives at the 4th port where the monitor photodiode is installed.

  \caption{Model of an eavesdropper for FSA implementation}
  \label{fig:countermeasure}
\end{figure}


The figure \ref{fig:Watchdog_photodiode} shows two dependencies: the lower limit of the optical power required to switch the photon detector from the Geiger mode and is the minimum required for a successful FSA by the eavesdropper; the upper limit is the optical power value, which is based on the parameters of the receiving module of the quantum communication system and the upper limit on the optical power of the control pulses. The minimum level in accordance with the calculation is 0.7 ~ μW, and the maximum is of the order of 300 ~ μW (within the framework of this study), but in fact it is limited by the threshold value of the APD inside the DOF, at which the current becomes too large and the diode burns out, incapacitating the whole device. Typical quantities are units and tens of milliwatts.
 
Based on the dependencies we can estimate the attenuation in a fixed attenuator, which will be sufficient to protect the monitor photodiode from exposure to light, and additional measures will not be required to expand the dynamic range of sensitivity to the input optical power in the direction of increase, since at optical powers below few nanowatts the measurement error becomes quite high.

Based on this, the attenuation value of 10~dB is sufficient, since the reflected central optical mode at the output from the 3rd port of the circulator passes through the attenuating element for the first time, and then after reflection from the mirror for the second time. The resulting attenuation by 20~dB, or 100 times, will reduce the minimum power level at the center frequency, which is enough to remove the detector from the photon counting mode, to a value of the order of 7~nW, which satisfies the requirements described above. The maximum level (within the framework of this researc) will decrease to about 3~μW.

\end{figure}


The third chapter shows that measuring the amount of optical radiation at the carrier frequency reflected from the optical filter using a monitor photodiode in the receiving unit of the quantum communication system at side frequencies in the range from 7~nW to 2.93~μW using additional countermeasures in the form of a passive optical attenuator with a losses nominal value of 10 dB to protect it allows you to withstand an attack by switching SPD from Geiger mode and FSA.

 \underline{\textbf{Fourth chapter}} describes the coherent states that are widely used in QCS, because coherent lasers are widely used as a radiation source.
 
  A distinctive feature of SCW QKD systems is the generation of multimode coherent states at different optical modes, depending on the frequency of the modulating signal, as shown in the figure \ref{fig:multimodes}. 

 \begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Modes_rus.pdf}
  \caption{Sidebands generation scheme}
  \label{fig:multimodes}
\end{figure}


Define these states as follows. Input (unmodulated) state at sender's sides (Alice) and (Bob) (denoted, as $A$ or $B$) are denoted, as $|\sqrt{\mu_0}\rangle_0\otimes|\mathrm{vac}\rangle_{SB}$, where $|\mathrm{vac}\rangle_{SB}$ is the sideband's vacuum state and $|\sqrt{\mu_0}\rangle_0$ is a carrier's coherent state with an amplitude (mean photon number per pulse $\mu_0$). The carrier is formed by coherent light beam on a frequency $\omega$. Carrier's phase is supposed to be reference and other phase shifts denotes with respect to it. Electro-optical phase modulator (with a modulating frequency $\Omega$ and the phase shift $\varphi_A$ or $\varphi_B$) distributes an energy fractions between interacting modes (extra frequencies $\omega_k=\omega+k\Omega$ are observed in the spectrum of the optical signal after modulator, considering our case with $2S$ sidebands so number of modes $k$ is limited by $-S\le k\le S$), so the phase modulator's output is the coherent multimode state: 
%
\begin{equation}\label{phi}
|\psi_0(\varphi_j)\rangle = \bigotimes_{k=-S}^S|{\alpha_k(\varphi_j)}\rangle_k,
\end{equation}
%
where $j$ is  $A$, and $B$ (defines Alice or Bob), and the signal's amplitude became as follows: 
%
\begin{equation}\label{alpha}
\alpha_k(\varphi_j)=\sqrt{\mu_0}d^S_{0k}(\beta)e^{i\varphi_jk},
\end{equation}
%
and $d^S_{nk}(\beta)$ is d-Wigner function from a quantum theory of angular momentum  %\cite{varshalovich1988quantum}
, $\beta$ defines by modulation index $m$, that could be noted without the dispersion effects as: 
%
\begin{equation}\label{betam}
\cos{({\beta})}=1-\frac{1}{2}{\left(\frac{m}{S+0.5}\right)^2},
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the interacting modes number taken very large.

After adjusting the relative phase $\phi_0$ of two optical signals in different arms the interference on the second beam splitter ($BS2$) is observed. Quantum states on the ($BS2$) outputs are described~\ref{states}. This relative phase should be adjusted to $\phi_0\approx0$. Then if the phase difference of modulating radio frequency signals of Alice and Bob modules is ($\Delta\varphi=0$), full multi-mode spectrum goes to first output of $BS2$, otherwise, even modes with the central one ($k = 0$ mode) go to the same output and odds modes go to the second output. In case of $\Delta\varphi=0$, the spectrum division of carrier and sidebands is necessary, because the latter contain the information for the key. It should be noted that due to low $m$ a significant contribution in multimode states is made only by the first pair. The case where $\Delta\varphi=\pi$ is nontrivial. Multi-mode states are divided on $BS2$ and even modes with the central one ($k = 0$ mode) goes to the first output, and odds modes (only first pair is significant) go to the second output as explained on fig. \ref{fig:Interference_result}. Thus, it is possible to abandon spectral separation using an optical filter in one of the output arms of the untrusted measurement unit. An indicator of a good phase adjustment of the optical pulses is a constant high level at the carrier's frequency in the first output (on $D2$).  


\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Interference_result.png}
  \caption{Interference of multi-mode weak coherent states}
  \label{fig:Interference_result}
\end{figure}

 
The fourth chapter shows that the method of quantum communication using subcarrier waves, or sidebands, allows to implement a protocol that is measurement-device independent.

Protocol for a quantum communication system using multimode coherent states with an untrusted measuring node is shown (Fig. \ref{fig:Protocol}). For simplicity, we give an example using only two phase states according to the B92 protocol. Alice randomly choses one phase state from two possible <<$0$>> or <<$\pi$>>. Bob, regardless of Alice, also randomly choses one of two phase states. As a result of the interference of multimode coherent states, 4 different results can be observed, depending on the phase difference chosen by Alice and Bob. In this case, spectral separation will occur on an untrusted detection node, so that sidebands will arrive at $D1$ and $D2$. At the same time, an eavesdropper has full access to an untrusted measuring node and can record for himself the announced detector's clicks. Suppose that we are only interested in the case in which the phase difference between $A$ and $B$ is $\pi$. The advantage of this case is that due to spectral separation as a result of interference into the arm with the detector $D1$, only the sidebands will always move to and the central mode will never move to, which means that an optical filter can be excluded from the optical circuit of this arm because matching it with the filter in the other output is a rather difficult engineering task. Thus, during sifting, only those bits remain that correspond to samples on $D1$, and for correlation between Alice's bits and Bob's bits, the latter must change the bit to the opposite (the so-called <<bitflip>>).

\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Protocol.png}
  \caption{Протокол}
  \label{fig:Protocol}
\end{figure}
 
  In the \underline{\textbf{fifth chapter}} the result of interference of a quantum signal at sidebands with phase coding on a symmetrical beam splitter in a QKD scheme with an untrusted measuring node is shown. The spectral separation of the quantum signal and the carrier's signal with their independent registration at different outputs of the beam splitter is observed. 
  
 The experimental setup scheme is shown in \ref{fig:RF_sin}. For simplicity, only one light source is used, the output of which is shared by a 50:50 $BS1$ beam splitter. This approach allows us to simulate the case when Alice and Bob have well-correlated light sources. In this experiment, a L1 distributed feedback laser (TTX1994 Neophotonics) is used. It's main features are a very narrow spectral linewidth lower than 100~kHz and a wide range of wavelength tuning (from 1530~nm to 1565.5~nm) with a high accuracy (20~pm). The output power was 10~mW. However, this value depends on the depth of the dynamic range of the variable optical attenuator VOA and the total losses introduced by Alice or Bob elements, since the resulting signal power at the sidebands should not exceed 2.56~pW, corresponding to the average number of photons per pulse 0.2 at 100~MHz repetition rate.

Due to the sensitivity of the resonator inside the laser source with distributed feedback (DFB) it necessary to protect it from reflections and scattering of signals. An optical fiber isolator (I) based on the Faraday effect with an isolation value higher than 50~dB is used in the optical scheme. To use the system in single-photon mode, a VOA with a sufficiently small tuning step of 0.05 dB and a large dynamic range of 60~dB is used.

\end{figure}

  
 
  
At the output from the source, the signal passed along the two arms of  a beam splitter, due to which it was simulated that Alice and Bob were separate nodes. In each node the information was encoded using phase modulators. The outputs of the first beam splitter were connected to the inputs of two independent 10~GHz electro-optical modulators based on $LiNbO_3$ (with built-in polarizer) $PM1$ and $PM2$. Polarizers reduced the sensitivity of modulators to the polarization of the input light beam, for which a polarization controller (PC) was used, and thus, the visibility of the interference pattern was increased. The electrical inputs $PM1$ and $PM2$ were connected to the outputs from the digital-to-analog D/A converters (DAC) with a modulating radio-frequency sinusoidal signal (with a frequency of 4.8~GHz). The amplitudes of the control signals were selected so that the signal power at the side frequencies was equal to Alice and Bob.

The modulation index, which shows the fraction of energy at the sidebands relative to the central frequency as a result of modulation, should be equal to 5~\%. In this case, the optimal signal to the noise ratio is observed due to optical filter's extinction ratio limit. So the average optical power was 2.56~pW, which corresponds to $\mu=0.2$.  


In this study, we used only two coding phase states on Alice and Bob ($\varphi_{A,B}\in\{0,\pi\}$. Phase difference ($\Delta\varphi$) between Alice and Bob was formed by changing the IQ tables of the DACs using FPGAs and software. In the case of measuring the dependence of the number of detectors clicks on the phase difference ($\Delta\varphi$) the phase was shifted sequentially with a step $\varphi_{step}\ = 10^{\circ}$. Signals on $PM1$ and $PM2$ outputs can be described as follows ~\ref{phi}.

After the states are prepared, we send them to the quantum channel. To compensate the optical path difference in the two arms of the interferometer, as well as to fine tune the optical phases of the signals, $PM3$ and $PM4$ were used. This adjustment was carried out by changing the DC voltage supplied to the modulators and generated by two independent electrical outputs of the signal generator $GEN1$ and $GEN2$. The outputs of the second pair of phase modulators were connected to a pair of input ports of the beam splitter $BS2$ 2x2 with a division ratio of 50:50.

The measurements were carried out in two stages: the first stage in classical light, the second stage - in the photon-counting mode on a superconducting single-photon detector (Scontel), in which two independent receivers $D1$, $D4$ are built-in. The quantum efficiency of both was 10~\%, and the level of dark noise did not exceed 50~Hz for each. The measured value of the total noise, including dark pickups and illumination from the center frequency due to the limited extinction of the optical filter, was $\gamma_{dark} = 1.5$ kHz.

The dependences of the sidebands intensity as a result of interference on the phase difference of the modulating signals in the classical mode and in the photon-counting mode are shown. The main parameters characterizing the QCS are estimated: the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the average value of the sifted key formation rate $ K $ (the same bits between legitimate users, but correlating with the possible result from the eavesdropper, which requires a procedure for privacy amplification)
